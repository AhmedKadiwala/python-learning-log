## 🐍 Python Learning Log

Welcome to my personal Python learning repository! This repo contains all my practice exercises, code snippets, and mini-projects based on **The Ultimate Python Handbook** — a beginner-friendly guide to learning Python programming.

## 📘 About This Repo

This repository is structured to follow the exact chapter flow of *The Ultimate Python Handbook*. Each chapter covers fundamental and advanced Python topics, complete with examples and practice problems.

I use this repository to:
- 📚 Reinforce what I learn chapter by chapter
- ✍️ Practice coding with hands-on exercises
- 🧠 Build a strong foundation in Python
- 🔁 Track my daily progress and maintain a GitHub streak
